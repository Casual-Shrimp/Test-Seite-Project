            <td rowspan="">This city just can’t catch a break. Once again, our so-called “friendly neighborhood” Spider-Man has plunged New York into mayhem. Late last night, witnesses report that the wall-crawling vigilante was seen swinging recklessly through downtown, leaving destruction in his wake!

                Local businesses suffered major damage after yet another battle between Spider-Man and one of his so-called "supervillains." And who pays for the damage? The hardworking citizens of New York, that's who!

                Enough is enough! This masked menace isn’t a hero. </td>

            <td></td>
            <td>He’s a danger, a vigilante playing by his own rules. How long before he really puts someone in the hospital—or worse?

                Instead of allowing this loose cannon to leap from building to building, the NYPD needs to step up and capture this web-slinger once and for all. The Bugle has always stood for justice, and we’ll continue to expose Spider-Man for what he truly is: a threat to the safety of every New Yorker.

                Spider-Man, if you’re reading this—and I’m sure you are—you might be able to fool the public, but you can’t fool me. The Daily Bugle will always stand against masked criminals who think they’re above the law.

                Enough webs. It’s time for the cuffs!</td>
